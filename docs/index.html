  <h1>Visual Update 1 for IBM Connections (Preview)</h1>
  <p>The IBM Collaboration Solution's Design team is crafting a new design language for IBM Connections. IBM developers will use this new design when building new Connections interfaces. The Connections design team is giving you a preview of the new design by leveraging IBM Connections Customizer to apply the visual updates to existing Connections interfaces. These updates also use the new IBM Plex Typeface.</p>

  <h2>App Catalog</h2>
  <p>The Connections design team has created an app, in the App Catalog, that leverages Connections Customizer to apply the new design as a configurable application to IBM Connections. The Customizer technology allows the new visual design to be layered on top of Connections, thus “overriding” the visual design prior to displaying it on the screen.</p>

  <h2>Example Files</h2>
  <p>The Connections design team is using Customizer to override the visual design of existing Connections applications. They are doing this by tracking down existing classes and ids and assigning new visual styles to them.</p>
